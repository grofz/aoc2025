Solving Advent of Code 2025 in Fortran

- *Day 1: Secret Entrance*

  Use brute force to simulate the rotation of safe-wheel and count how
  many times it passes through 0. Modulo approach did not work for Part 2.

- *Day 2: Gift Shop*

  Search for a repeating pattern in ranges of the numbers. Conversion between
  number and string using internal file I/O.

- *Day 3: Lobby*

  Select 2 (Part 1) or 12 (Part 2) digits from the block of digits to maximize
  the number formed from selected digits. Nice and clean solution.
  Brute-force would probably fail in Part 2.
